# Database models

- [Relational model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model) (SQL) (data are stored in multiple, linked regular tables; data are clearly separated from applications; 1970s)
- [Object database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_database) (tightly connected to objects in an object-oriented application; 1990s)
- NoSQL (approx. “not only SQL”)

Obviously, different representations of data lead to some operations being easy and other operations complex (e.g. [*object-relational impedance mismatch*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_impedance_mismatch) refers to difficulties in using relational data models with object-oriented programming techniques).
